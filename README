String-Tests

It is very common (for example when doing user input validation) to have to run
a series of tests on a single string of data. This module attempts to ease the
burden of doing so, by amalgamating all tests into a single boolean method call.

INSTALLATION

To install this module, run the following commands:

	perl Makefile.PL
